# 🌐 Landing Page Project

A responsive and visually appealing **landing page** built with HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.  
Designed to present a product, service, or brand in a clean, modern way.

## 🔍 Overview

This is a static **landing page** template that highlights core information and calls-to-action (CTAs).  
The goal is to engage users, provide an attractive first impression, and direct them to take desired actions (e.g. subscribe, purchase, learn more).

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**  
   Defines sections like hero banner, features, testimonials, call-to-action, footer, etc.

2. **CSS Styling & Layout**  
   Uses Flexbox / Grid (or classic CSS) to create responsive layouts that look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

3. **Responsive Design**  
   Media queries ensure the page adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.

4. **Optional Interactions**  
   Minimal JavaScript (if present) handles interactivity such as smooth scroll, toggling menus, or animations.
